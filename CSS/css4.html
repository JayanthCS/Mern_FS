        <h3>This means: When you set the width/height of an element, the element often appears bigger than you have set
            (because the element's border and padding are added to the element's specified width/height).</h3>
    </div>

        <p>Since the result of using the box-sizing: border-box; is so much better, many developers want all elements on
            their pages to work this ways.
            The code below ensures that all elements are sized in this more intuitive way. Many browsers already use
            box-sizing: border-box; for many form elements (but not all - which is why inputs and text areas look
            different
            at width: 100%;).
            Applying this to all elements is safe and wise:
